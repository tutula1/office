# Laravel 5.2 ACL

A Laravel 5.2 Access Control List with Roles and Permissions, the Permission will be checked by a Middleware. 

In the registration process the new user gets a role (role_id = 1), therefore you need to create a role before you create or register a user.

**Changing the role of the user when he signs up:** app\Services\Registrar.php

**Adding a permission to route:** app\Http\routes.php
- middleware = name given to the middleware in the app\Http\Kernel.php file.
- permission = name of the permission. (If the user has a role with this permission he can access the page.)
- uses = name of the controller.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
